        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, My name is Mattilee Kazemipour. I am a current student at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in psychology, and I am in my third year. I will be graduating in June 2024 with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. I am interested in getting a teaching credential after I graduate, and then go on to become a third grade elementary school teacher. 

The first work experience that I have is being a volunteer at Atria Senior Living. This is a senior home that I volunteered in in Mission Viejo, California. There, I helped out with the games that the residents participated in. One of the games I helped with was bingo. I would set up the game, call out the numbers, and then give out the tickets that they used at the home, that the residents could use to get prizes at the home. In addition, I helped out with this horse racing game they would play. It was a game where the residents would bet on which wooden horse would get to the finish line first. We would also give out tickets to those who would win. At the end of the day, I would clean up the game room where they would play these games. 
<br><br>

        I also have worked at the Betterlife Vitamin Store, which is a vitamin store in Santa Ana, California. There are many different types of tasks that I had to perform while working there. I would charge the online orders that the store would get, and print out the shipping labels. I would also unpack any new deliveries that would come to the store, and then put them on the shelves in the correct places. In addition, I would pack these online orders and then deliver them all to the post office at the end of the day. I also would deal with the in-store customers that would come into the store. If they had any questions about a product or where to find something, I would help them with that and also check out any items they wanted to purchase. <br><br>

        My current occupation is a physical education coach at an elementary school. I work for a company called Kicks 2 Learn that offers their physical education program to many different schools and districts, such as Colton, Perris, and Corona. I currently work for the Colton District elementary schools. I teach all grades between kindergarten and sixth grade throughout each day. There are a variety of games that we teach the students, such as sharks and minnows, duck duck goose, hot potato, silent ball, basketball, knockout (a form of basketball), kickball, and soccer. In addition to doing all of this during the school day, I also teach at the after school program in the Corona School District. We do more indoor activities for the afterschool program, such as helping the students with their homework, teaching them art projects/drawing, playing legos with them, and playing indoor sports, like dodgeball and indoor soccer.
